1.1,,Filesystem Configuration,published,,"Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.

The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.

**Note:** If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the `/tmp` directory, this data will still consume space in `/` once the `/tmp` filesystem is mounted unless it is removed first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.1.1,,Disable unused filesystems,published,,"A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.

Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less attractive.

**Note**: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program.

Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.

Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.

2.2.1,2.2.1.2,Ensure systemd-timesyncd is configured,published,not_scored,"systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group ""systemd-timesync"" needs to be created on installation of systemd.

**Note:** The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

4,,Logging and Auditing,published,,"The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.

It is recommended that `rsyslog` be used for logging (with `logwatch` providing summarization) and `auditd` be used for auditing (with `aureport` providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.

In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.

Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network.

It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.

**Note on log file permissions:** 
There really isn't a ""one size fits all"" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as ""wheel"" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (`root:root 600`). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as `root:securegrp 640` where `securegrp` is the defined security group (in some cases `wheel`).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.1,,Configure System Accounting (auditd),published,,"System auditing, through `auditd`, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.

The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations. **Note:** For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.

**Note:** Several recommendations in this section filter based off of `auid>=1000` for unprivileged non-system users. Some distributions split at `UID 500` instead, consult your documentation and/or the `UID_MIN` setting in `/etc/login.defs` to determine which is appropriate for you.

**Note:** Once all audit rules have been added to a file or files in the `/etc/audit/rules.d/` directory, the auditd service must be re-started, or the system rebooted, for the new rules to be included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4.1.2,,Configure Data Retention,published,,"When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted.
